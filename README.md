## We're Killer Rabbit Studios.

we make scary stuff. Hopefully.

## Who are we though?

A team of two from Canada.

**Noelle**, a programmer and musician

**Aidan**, an artist and writer

We work together to create cool stuff.

We also both love horror films so maybe we'll make one eventually.

## What do we want to make?

We already said. Scary stuff.

To be more percise, we're working on a Walten Files fangame currently.

We're also planning on making another horror game after inspired by Silent Hill, Little Nightmares, Still Wakes The Deep, and Iron Lung.
